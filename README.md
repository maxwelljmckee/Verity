## Purpose
Verity News App is your information hub. There's so much news out there these days, it can be hard to know who to trust or where to look. With Verity, all of your information is in one place, making it easier to find what you're looking for. Users can filter articles by category, publication, or keyword, and can even craft their own custom `channels` by grouping their favorite publications together.

## Getting Started
The easiest way to get started with the Verity News App is to navigate to https://verity-news.herokuapp.com and login as a demo user.
If you'd prefer to take a deeper dive into the code, you can download the project, install the dependencies in both the frontend and backend directories, and run `npm start` in both directories to launch the localhost development servers.
